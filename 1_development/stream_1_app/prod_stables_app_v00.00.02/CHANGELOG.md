## [Unreleased]

Post–**v00.00.02** work in the active dev folder. **Do not** describe these items as part of showcase **v00.00.02** in public posts until this section is merged into a new released label and zip.

### Changed

- **Help, Stables Academy:** subtitle under the page title now reads **Questionnaires, score tracking, certificates** (plural).

- **Social link previews (X / Discord / others):** Open Graph and Twitter Card meta on the showcase shell with canonical URL `https://stablescouncil.org/dapp/`, preview image `https://stablescouncil.org/brand/assets/twitter-header.png` (site brand header, not StablesAgent art), `twitter:site` (`@StablesCouncil`), `og:image` width/height 1500×500 to match that asset, and alt **Stables MiniDapp showcase** (no em dash).

- **Help → The Stables Academy** (first Help item): Security questionnaire (10 random from bank, 3 options, mandatory gate + minimum 6/10), retake cool-down, best score kept, optional demographics after quiz, anonymized public-DB consent, certificate + share; other topics listed as coming soon.
- **Stables Academy Security flow:** one question at a time; demographics and consent after the 10 knowledge questions; choice to show correctness **after each answer** or **only at the end**.

## [00.00.02] — 2026-04-02 (showcase published)

Released showcase build **v00.00.02** (“v2”). See `0_handshake/minidapp_version_log.md` for scope vs later dev-only features (**Academy is not in this release**).

### Changed

- Bumped `APP_BUILD_VERSION` / `dapp.conf` to `00.00.02` for the published showcase line (aligned with published zip when shipped).
- **Mint xWiniwa** chart now uses an **EMA-smoothed leverage trace** while preserving the same live endpoint value.
- **Legal & notices / Privacy** were consolidated: legal section retitled to **Minima dependencies**, copy clarified around architecture/device responsibility/self-custody framing, privacy wording shifted to **local-storage/no telemetry from this static copy**, and security/legal blocks gained clearer StablesAgent/Charter guidance via `openStablesCharterUrl()`.
- **On/Off Ramp** was rebuilt into a release-ready flow: mirrored **6-step on-ramp/off-ramp**, clearer venue/bridge ordering, section title **Where to buy Minima**, and a single **Paper ↔ Stables (And back)** visual with icon references and optional-step styling.
- **On/Off Ramp interactions** now deep-link key steps to Mint: **step 6 Mint Stables** opens Mint Wables mint block and **step 1 Burn to MINIMA** opens Burn Wables block.
- **On/Off Ramp copy/UI** finalized: step 1 partner-exchange wording, step 5 send-MINIMA wording, Stables hub simplified label, compact inline **Get Winiwa - No value** control beside step 4, and right-aligned long-label layout fixes.
- **Welcome personalisation** flow now keeps continuity: **Open Contacts** shows a same-style **later stage** notice and continues to Step 4, and **Step 4** no longer shows **I'll do that later**.
- **Welcome showcase intro** now adds a helper line under **I understand**: users can click outside the modal to skip the whole welcome process.
- **Welcome personalisation intro** is cleaner: removed the **Optional** badge and removed the intro **I'll do that later** button, keeping the modal-exit behaviour as the skip path.
- **Browser tab title** is now fixed to **Stables - BYOB** and no longer changes with personalised bank naming.
- **Top bar subtitle behavior** now defaults to **Be your own bank** and only switches to **By Stables/Minima** when a custom bank name is set.
- **My profile** now includes explicit mode controls: **Use my settings** and **Use default settings**, so users can keep profile data saved but switch branding behavior at any time.

### Added

- **Invest → Maximize** tab: copy and outbound links to stake MINIMA via the official Minima **Maximize** MiniDapp (MiniDapps hub + docs).
- **Mint xWiniwa**: chart **below** the Mint xWiniwa button: **three** traces — **Winiwa · USD** (spot), **xWiniwa · USD** (spot × leverage), **Leverage** (right axis from **CR% / (CR% − 100%)**, e.g. 130% → 130/30); historical leg interpolates **`CR_HIST_DATA`** with **today** = live `#protocolCRBig`; **Current leverage** row + `SIM_XWM` / mint math use same formula. ~365d CoinGecko Winiwa spot; hover/touch tooltip; tighter margins, taller plot.
- **Welcome → currencies/personalisation**: **Unselect all** next to **Select all**; **Save and continue** into optional personalisation (**Step 1–4 of 4**: bank name, profile picture, contacts onboarding, directory preview); **Finish** saves council profile (name + avatar when set) and closes welcome. Bank-name copy clarifies **private vs on transactions**, changeable anytime in **My profile**.
- **Branding**: MiniDapp **headline** / page **title** / default top bar tagline **By Stables on Minima** (replaces “Be your own bank” in those places). **Top bar** shows **My profile** picture and display name (or welcome bank name) when set; when the title is **personalised** (not the default **Stables** wordmark), the subtitle switches to **by Stables/Minima**. **Brand hover**: custom panel (cyan–purple gradient text, dark frame) **“My bank made possible by Stables on Minima”** replaces the old **Home** `title` tooltip; keyboard focus shows the same panel. **Touch (`hover: none`)**: tap the **tagline** to toggle that panel; tap the tooltip, outside the bar, or the logo/title row to dismiss / go home. Center pill **Showcase · v…** tracks **`APP_BUILD_VERSION`** from `runtime-config.js` (currently **00.00.02**).
- **Legal & notices**: **Minima dependencies** section (foundation + corporate independence + open networks + **unstoppable** framing + non-custodial seizure/blocking; not legal advice).
- **Amount inputs**: **Available** balance for the relevant asset next to **Exchange** (send + receive balance hint), **Send** / **Receive** modals, **Create invoice**, **Coverage fund** deposit amount, **Burn Wables** (per selected stable); **MAX** fills the field from that balance (where it already existed for mint / LP, unchanged). Labels refresh with **global UI** and currency changes.
- **Send / Receive modals**: currency **dropdown options** show **each enabled wallet currency with its balance** (`Code · amount`, tabular numbers, wider select). Refreshes whenever the wallet UI syncs.
